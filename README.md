Scripts to automate Fuzz export from houdini as an  ASS sequence
  Nomenclature is based on our graduation short wich used Ramses from Rx-lab
  https://ramses.rxlab.guide/
  
1 - Build up the Hython command with the maya script, stored into a csv file in the FX directory
2 - use the Fuzzinator to choose wich shot you want to render
3 - when the render is finished import the Fuzz using the import script
